# Pygments highlighting for JupyterLab

The CSS in the package is automatically generated using [jupyterlab_pygments](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_pygments).

You can run the Python script in order to regenerate it:

```bash
python generate_css
```

Then you will probably need to run the JupyterLab linter `jlpm run prettier` and commit.
