Overview
--------

JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as notebooks,
text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and
extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by
side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities
integrate with each other (for example, you can run a code chunk from a text
editor in a code console with a keystroke, you can open a live preview of a
Markdown, CSV, or Vega document you are editing, and you can drag cells between
notebooks). JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of the
JupyterLab, including extending existing components or providing new activities,
themes, and file viewers and editors.

:ref:`JupyterLab has full support for Jupyter Notebook documents. <notebook>`
JupyterLab also enables other models of interactive computing:

-  :ref:`code_console` provide transient scratchpads for running code
   interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be
   linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for
   example.
-  :ref:`Kernel-backed documents <kernel-backed-documents>` enable code in any
   text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any
   Jupyter kernel.
-  Notebook cell outputs can be pulled into their own tab, side by side with
   the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by
   a kernel.
-  Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live
   editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to
   have live preview of Markdown documents, or edit GeoJSON files with live
   updates of an adjoining map.

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats.
JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF,
Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats.
See :ref:`file-and-output-formats` for more information.

To navigate the user interface, JupyterLab offers :ref:`customizable keyboard shortcuts <shortcuts>`
and the ability to use key maps from vim, emacs, and Sublime Text.

JupyterLab is served from the same `server
<https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ and uses the same
`notebook document format <http://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ as the
classic Jupyter Notebook. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter
Notebook after JupyterLab reaches 1.0.
